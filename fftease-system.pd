#X text 45 27 FFT size is overlap times the fftease subpatch block
size (256 in our examples). With a blocksize of 256 and overlap 4 your
FFT size is 1024 Higher overlap generally gives higher quality \, but
CPU load is proportional to overlap \, so if you double the overlap
\, you double the CPU load.;
#X text 33 245 winfac determines the ratio between the FFT size and
an input window that funnels samples into the FFT. Roughly speaking
\, smaller window sizes (minimum is 1) give tighter temporal response
\, but higher sizes can improve frequency performance \, especially
with lower FFT sizes.;
#X text 29 337 It is recommended that overlap and winfac only be used
when the DACs are off. They can potentially crash Pd when the DACs
are active.;
